Kate is the loving wife of <a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/">Tim Rayburn</a>.<br />
She is a homemaker who is learning to code out of self-defense in order to understand all of the odd words that come out of Tim's mouth. She grew up on a farm in Virginia but moved to Texas to attend graduate school where she met Tim. Her other hobbies include knitting, reading, and hanging out with her beautiful dog Gandalf.
